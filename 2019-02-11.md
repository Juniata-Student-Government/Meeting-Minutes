-   Presentation by Dean Lisa McDaniels about the Juniata Learning
    Commons Project

    -   Support the new curriculum, "Ways of Knowing, Inquiry and
        Research."

    -   Make the idea of research less intimidating

    -   Learning Commons to be flexible and adaptable for the users.
        Furniture can move. Wants a learner centered environment

    -   Getting a new elevator

    -   Encourage students to visit the writing center/classroom in the
        basement of the library.

    -   Last years seniors donated senior gift to have learning-centered
        classroom in the library.

    -   More rooms for groups and private study rooms

    -   Full service cafe

    -   Most changes on the first floor to the right of the entrance.

    -   There will be a quiet reading room.

    -   Hopes that parts of the simplified studio and TSC will be moved
        to the library

    -   Put student art into the library

    -   Vidal expressed concern that it will be harder to study in the
        library. Many things will be added, and there will be a lot
        going on. "Does this help us focus or does it just look new and
        fancy"

        -   The variety is not arbitrary - is to accommodate that people
            learn in a variety of different ways. Not everyone needs
            total silence.

        -   Echo compared to her hometown learning commons and said that
            the diversity had shown people that they learned better in
            different learning situations. Opportunity to explore how we
            learn, the more diversity there is. Works much better than
            originally thought.

    -   There is time for input. This library is for the students.

    -   Ran out of time to discuss library hours. Best way to contact is
        to visit Lisa in her office, send an email.

    -   Library event 4-5 to try some food made from archive recipes.
        February 19th.

-   Culinary council 3-4 starts the 21st

-   Allocations Board Position will be filled by the end of this week

-   Motion to postpone the meeting times to twice a week until next
    semester.

    -   Concern that the twice a week won't happen unless we do it now.

    -   We have been running out of time in the meetings.

    -   Suggestions to have the meeting extended to 1.5 hours

-   Motion to hold mandatory meetings and non mandatory meetings -
    non-mandatory meetings will be for presentations while mandatory
    meetings will be held for official business and voting.

    -   People not showing up to presentations will be very bad.

-   Executive Board will send out a poll for all three motions.

    -   Extend bi weekly meetings to 1.5 hours every other week

    -   One mandatory, one non-mandatory meeting

    -   Postpone the decision to have weekly meetings until next
        semester.

-   Suggest that a representative from each class and committee meets to
    discuss options. Email Ambrose the representatives and he will set a
    meeting time.
