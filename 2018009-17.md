4\. Open Forum with President Troha About Budget

a.  Troha will make his PowerPoint presentation available to students --
    > more information to come on where to find it

b.  Compensation expenses are equally divided amongst Faculty and
    > Administration, 29% and 28% of the 41%, plus Facilities Services

c.  Departmental Expenses refers to the working budget for each office

d.  Student Wages were so broadly cut from the Budget due to the desire
    > to cut their funding by \$200,000 and make sure Students are doing
    > work that cannot be done by a supervisor and those positions are
    > necessary, which has resulted in decreased hours and positions, as
    > a result of Student Wages being a major expense of \$1 million

e.  Financial Aid is being stressed as a variable for Student Employment
    > by supervisors, though skill set remains more important

f.  Despite 41% of the Budget being dedicated to Compensation, there
    > were no raises for Staff last year -- This was the result of
    > donors giving for buildings, not Staff Wages, they want to give
    > money for the General Education Curriculum and because of major
    > healthcare claims and not meeting the Enrollment or Retention
    > target

g.  The Budget Presentation President Troha gave was the same as the one
    > he delivered to the Community, minus some employee stuff

h.  Concerns were raised that the Presentation failed to explain where
    > the extra food costs or parking pass costs are going

i.  How do you, President Troha, justify sacrificing the needs of
    > students for the future based on the fact that many students have
    > cited affordability as the reason they transferred? -- Everyone
    > has an interest in the success of the College because of how it
    > affects the value of our education, Troha sees short-term pain as
    > necessary for long-term success, but is willing to have a
    > conversation about how to improve individual student experiences

j.  Student workers are not affordable because they were an expense the
    > College was able to cut without impacting the Student Experience
    > and because the College can do without Student Employees whereas
    > it cannot do without Utilities, for example

k.  Cost of Tuition for families remains the same over last 5 years
    > because Tuition is subsidized by the College with Financial Aid at
    > levels that make it the same

l.  Housing options reflect poor-quality Residence Halls and there is no
    > part of the Budget being used to renovate the dorms, low-interest
    > loan to refurbish? -- Dorm renovations are not "sexy" projects,
    > even though Donors understand how important the Residential Life
    > experience is

m.  Maybe donors do not know what students want, such as new dorm
    > furniture, because what is being advertised -- New Library -- is
    > not what the students want

n.  Partner with Advertising Team to have a campaign geared toward
    > donors including virtual tours with students and have students
    > talk with students

o.  Recruiting approaches have shifted toward recruiting in the Mid-west
    > and West and working harder in areas where people know Juniata

p.  The peaks and valleys in the Enrollment Trend are averaged over the
    > last 5 years to determine a target for Enrollment, and similarly
    > for Retention

q.  Matthew Damschroder will make revenue raises over the last 10 years
    > available to students -- more information on that to come

r.  Why has Juniata not changed its admissions standards to admit the
    > same number of students each year? -- The College receives
    > 2300-2500 applications, but the yield rate of those admitted from
    > that pool is only around 20%

s.  Facilities has the resources to handle cases such as mold and should
    > be contacted, Matthew Damschroder or Erin Paschal can also be
    > contacted to handle such a situation
