-   Combatting food waste in Baker Refractory

-   How much food can be taken out of Baker? Answer: You can take a meal
    or some snacks and the issue is with the new hires who are not aware
    of this rule

-   Food options/quality of Eagle's Landing (Muddy)

-   Muddy is now a part of Baker and all-you-can-eat, but issues with
    small portion sizes and long lines

-   Confusion over Parkhurst Policies, such as Ecoshell structure

-   Taking food out of Eagle's Landing is not permitted and does not
    exist as an on-the-go option any more

-   Issue of asking for larger portion in Baker and being told need to
    finish single serving at a time

-   Increased hours are a positive

-   Need to change late-night options to comfort/fried, snack food

-   The meal plan is covering off-campus meals more effectively

-   Pre-made meals need to be expanded upon, such as allowing meal
    swipes at non-Ellis locations and restructuring the 24-hours in
    advance system to order a pre-made meal

-   Accommodations need to be made during peak meal times to help with
    long lines

-   Accommodations need to be made at non-peak meal times to provide
    students with more food options than pizza, salad, and burgers

-   Students on Gold Plan feel slighted because they are paying more
    than those on the Commuter Plan for less meals

-   Reminders by Matthew that we must work within the frame of the
    contract, he is willing to work with students facing financial
    concerns, and will consider swapping the lower tier meal plans

-   Matthew regrets the decision process to switch dining service
    providers and is willing to add flexibility to the meal plan
    wherever he can help do so
