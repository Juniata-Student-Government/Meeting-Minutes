2\. Good Neighbor Initiative Presentation by Jesse Leonard, Director of
Public Safety

a.  As students, you have been granted permission to live in a
    non-college housing in the Huntingdon community and should take the
    opportunity to integrate yourself into the community

b.  As temporary residents, you have the same rights as permanent
    residents

c.  The Good Neighbor Initiative includes taking the time to get to know
    and respecting your neighbors

d.  Parking: Students who have vehicles are expected to register the
    vehicle with Public Safety regardless of whether you intend to park
    in college parking lots or on borough streets. Unregistered vehicles
    may be ticketed.

e.  Snow Removal: The borough has ordinances pertaining to removal of
    snow and ice from sidewalks

f.  Help Out: Typically run through the Office of Community Engagement,
    examples could be helping mow your neighbors' lawns or shoveling
    their snow

g.  Watch your noise levels: Please recognize and exercise appropriate
    quiet hours! Remember, permanent residents have jobs and families
    that include children. There is a noise ordinance in Huntingdon

h.  Social Functions and Parties: Be responsible hosts as it relates to
    parking, noise, and littering. Only have social gatherings on the
    weekends and abide by the law. Have safe and problem-free parties.
    Remember, you are responsible for the behavior of all guests

i.  Start off on the right foot: Take positive steps to alleviate
    negative assumptions.

j.  Be Proud: Take pride in the appearance of your house/apartment and
    the neighborhood

k.  Disorderly Law: The Huntingdon Borough adopted a "disorderly" law
    that allows authorities to cite not only property owners or

    that prohibits open containers of alcoholic beverages to be
    possessed on public property

4\. Questions for Jesse Leonard

a.  Pertaining to the Blue Light System, are more Blue Lights more being
    put in? Yes, Public Safety is looking into that. There are four
    currently, two along the walkway to East, one up at the Nathan
    Parking Lot and one behind BAC

b.  The Blue Light calls may not be answered if multiple calls are
    coming in at the same time and they are full

c.  There is a time limit on the Blue Light call, meaning an Officer
    might get cut off because it works via radio

d.  Escort service is underused

e.  Incidents of people from Huntingdon coming into East and other
    residence halls and doing their laundry. Call Public Safety

f.  Cleary Report runs by year so the 2017 stats are out now

g.  Cameras? There are some posted in strategic places around campus in
    places that community members interact more with students, such as
    Ellis or the Gym. They are a deterrent and Public Safety is open to
    putting in more if there are locations students are interested in
    having them

5\. Announcements

    at the Clifton 5 for \$5 for all Juniata students

    interest

4\. Open Forum

a.  How do you feel we should respond to input at President Troha's and
    Jesse Leonard's meetings? Posting the meeting minutes outside of
    Baker on the Student Government Board is a good first step, but not
    enough. Brainstorm ideas for next Senate meeting.

b.  Policy and Project's pictures will be put up on the Student
    Government Board outside of Baker

c.  Senior gift idea? Shoot Senior Officers an email with any ideas if
    you are a senior!

    events. Brainstorm ideas for next Senate meeting
